Florist website I created for a friend - my FIRST ever website

This is my first ever PHP website (again, pre-WordPress) and possibly my first website of all!

I created this for a friend's floristry business in about 2007 (since relaucnhed), using PDSs from a design company and my own CSS, HTML and PHP.
